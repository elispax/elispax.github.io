    Junior UX/UI Designer
  </p>
<p>
  I'm Elisa, a <strong>Junior UX/UI Designer</strong> based in Paris. I help teams turn complex ideas into clear, intuitive digital products. With a strong visual background, including in-house fashion photography and graphic design, I bring a <strong>versatile eye for detail</strong> and a grounded, <strong>problem-solving approach</strong> to every project.
</p>

<p>
  I’ve worked on mobile apps and digital products such as Konduit.Channel, contributing to <strong>user journeys</strong>, refining <strong>product flows</strong>, and designing interfaces that feel <strong>simple, cohesive, and purposeful</strong>. My approach blends <strong>visual clarity</strong> with thoughtful <strong>UX thinking</strong>, grounded in experimentation and real user needs.
</p>

<p>
  I enjoy working collaboratively and adapting quickly across different project phases — from early concepts to polished interfaces. I’m particularly interested in roles where design, usability, and visual consistency come together to support meaningful, <strong>user-centered solutions</strong>.
